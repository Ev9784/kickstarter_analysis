# Kickstarting with Excel

## *Kickstarter Analysis Overview* 

The Kickstarter Analysis is a critical review of data spread over several thousand cells; the topic of the data is theater. The main objective of this data is to detect fundings and future launch dates. 

This project uncovers the critical likelihood that a campaign(play) will succeed, fail, or be canceled. Analysis and Challenges first started in (column E) using Scientific notation. Once I filtered the Kickstarter data into categories, these subcategories were their column(s). "Parent category" and "Subcategory." This data was then converted into a pivot table. Pivot tables are tools that condense data into a visual summary in this visual representation of data. This data was the parent categories of campaigns by year and filtered into successful, failed, and canceled. 

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date* 
I pulled this data from our initial data entree in Kickstarter. This section's parent is theater and year. These months show a breakdown of Louise's success, failure, cancellation, and total from January to December. Once this data was configured to display success rates, I converted the information to a line chart for theater outcomes based on the launch date. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 This data supports the following sections: goals: successful, failed, canceled, and total projects. It later breaks down the same categories into percentages based on the data provided. These outcomes are based on (plays) showing the succession rates in 5,000 increments. 

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes-based on Launch Date?** 
    I would say that May is the best month to launch a play. Despite having the highest number of failed, it also has the highest data for successful campaigns. 

- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes-based on Goals?**
    Based on the percent successful report, Louise's highest success rate is between 0 - 44999. Anything over 50000 will lead to a 0% success rate.  

- **What are some limitations of this dataset?** 
    Out of all of the categories provided in the Kickstarter, we are limiting our findings to two types. 

- **What are some other possible tables and graphs that we could create?**
    For the most part, Data trends are nicely represented in the line charts provided; my only recommendation is a pie chart. This will be a visualization of what categories are performing over others. I can break this into "seasons that perform well over others." Examples months May-July perform better than Oct-Dec.
